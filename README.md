Evaluate news NLP (Natural Processing Language) 

By this project, you can run NLP on articles and blogs on another website only through entering the URL

Detailed about the coding: 
I applied the webpack to this project for managing my files and make some features easier to implement. 
Also, I used the Aylien API to activate the NLP, so I created the server and client-side to fetch the requested content from the API.
